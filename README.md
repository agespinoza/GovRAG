# GovRAG 🏛️📚
### Governed Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Expert Knowledge

GovRAG is a **domain-agnostic AI knowledge platform** that transforms expert content into:

- versioned knowledge
- approved & governed content
- AI-queryable trusted sources
- auditable RAG responses

This project is designed as a **flagship applied AI + data platform**.

---

# ✨ Why GovRAG?

Traditional RAG retrieves everything.

GovRAG retrieves **only approved and trusted knowledge**.

This enables:

- Industrial AI copilots
- Operational decision support
- AI with governance
- Traceable answers with citations

---

# 🧠 Core Principles

- Knowledge is versioned
- Content must be approved
- AI only uses trusted sources
- Feedback becomes ML training data
